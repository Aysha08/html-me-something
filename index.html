<p>Hello! I am Ay&apos;sha! I'd like to consider myself as a puzzle. There are many bits and pieces that make up a big picture.
     I am inspired by many things and I enjoy many things. Some of my favorite things are science, technology, art, music, and food! I enjoy traveling and spending time with my loved ones.
     My ultimate goal is to live my best life and serve my purpose in this world. Follow along as I break 
     down a few pieces of the puzzle.</p> <img src="Beach_please.JPG" width="300" length="300"/>

    <h1>Memphis Made Mane!</h1>
    <p>I am from Memphis, Tennessee! I love everything about my hometown! I believe Memphis has so much potential to be just as great if not 
        greater than other cities. I am a proud Memphian and 
        I plan to make an positive impact within this city! Memphis versus Everybody! <strong>Go Grizz!</strong></p>
        
     <h2>Go STEM!</h2>
     <p>I have always had an affinity for the sciences. I can recall staying up late nights watching Bill Nye the Science Guy. 
         I also grew up watching my aunts install our home PC and eventually learned how to install and sometimes fix the computer on my own.
         This is the reason I am a STEM student today. I am currently studying Chemistry in pursuit to research medicine at St. Jude Children's 
         Research Hospital. I have earned two CompTIA certifications, IT Fundamentals and A+. Since earning my certifications, I have began building a mobile device 
         repair business called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/All-Things-Tech-Repair-324411191706805/">All Things Tech Repair</a>. In the next 
         five years, I plan to be researching at my dream job, owning my own business (All Things Tech&reg;), and advocating STEM education for underrepresented youth.</p>

     <h3>Press Play!</h3>
     <p>As quoted by one of my favorite songwriters, Stephen "Static Major" Garrett, "Music is like breathing." I love listening to music! When I was
         younger, I would collect CDs and spend most of my day watching music television. I enjoy listening to gospel, r&b, hip hop, pop and neo-soul. 
         I enjoy attending concerts and music festivals. If I could see any artist live in concert, it would be the King of Pop, Michael Jackson!</p>

     <h4>Art Lover!</h4>
     <p>Visiting art galleries is also a favorite hobby of mine. I enjoy original artwork including photography and street art. I find myself 
         fascinated with pieces that express raw emotion and celebrates culture. I recently visited an art gallery, Studio BE, located in New
         Orleans, Louisiana. My favorite piece was a canvas of a little carefree black girl. My ultimate goal is to start collecting artwork.
